To create a faster and stratigicly effective algorithum for playing Civilisation VI so as someone can play alone with an intresting openent and not have to wait for a long period between turns, Including in games with many AI players and a large map. This is especially important as their is already an intergrated algorithum, However it is very basic and can take severy minuets to process all the AI players.

Using it must be as easy as the built in AI therefore It should intergrate as a mod into Civilisation
